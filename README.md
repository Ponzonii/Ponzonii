Hey, what's up? My name is Luiz, more specifically Luiz Henrique Ponzoni Galhardo, my nickname is Ponzonii. I'm 13 years old and dream of someday becoming a programmer. I have some experience with Python, HTML, and CSS.

I want to be a programmer who builds websites; I think that's a really cool field. Well, that's all for now. Thank you so much for reading. Bye!
